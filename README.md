## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursing my MBA at the Yale School of Management. Before business school, I was working in tech consulting for 4 years implementing custom software solutions for clients. I hold a BS in Computer Engineering and am fluent in C++, Python and JavaScript, but am always open for the challenge of a new language.
